## Installing Python
The Recipe Image Generator is written in Python, which means that you need to have Python installed on your computer to use the tool. If you don't have Python installed, you can download the latest stable version from the official Python website at [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

It's important to note that you should not download Python from the Microsoft Store, as this has been known to cause issues with the tool and with Python in general.

When you install Python, be sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH". This will ensure that you can use the tool from the command line.
